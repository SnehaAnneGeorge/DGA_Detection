# Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) Detection

## Problem Statement

Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) use specific parameters as random seeds to generate a large number of random domain names. This technique makes it difficult to detect malicious domain names, significantly complicating the defense against botnets and malware.

## Program Flow Overview

### 1. Load and Process Data
- **Load the Dataset:** Prompt the user to provide the filename of a training dataset (CSV or Excel).
- **Extract Features:** Extract features from each domain, including:
  - Domain length
  - Digit count
  - Number of special characters
  - Number of subdomains
  - Entropy

### 2. Model Training
- **Preprocess Data:**
  1. Separate features (`X`) and the target variable (`y`), indicating whether a domain is DGA (1) or non-DGA (0).
  2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
  3. Define a pipeline for preprocessing (handling missing values) and train a **Decision Tree Classifier**.
- **Train the Model:** Train the pipeline using the training data (`X_train` and `y_train`).
- **Save the Model:** Save the trained model pipeline to `dga_detection_model.pkl` using joblib.

### 3. Classification
- **Load and Preprocess New Data:**
  1. Prompt the user to provide the filename of a new dataset for testing.
  2. Load the saved model and the new dataset.
  3. Extract features from the new dataset.
- **Classify Data:**
  1. Make predictions using the loaded model.
  2. Print the number of detected DGA and non-DGA URLs.
  3. Save predictions to `dga_predictions.csv`.

### 4. Interactive Elements
- Prompt the user to specify training and prediction files.
- Execute training and classification processes based on user inputs.

## Machine Learning Model: Decision Tree Classifier

The **Decision Tree** classifier operates by splitting the data into subsets based on the value of the most significant feature, forming a tree-like structure of decisions. This model is suitable for this problem due to its high performance in classification tasks and its ability to handle both categorical and numerical data.

## Categories Explained

### 1. DGA Domains
- **Definition:** Domains generated by Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) used by cybercriminals to create a large number of random domain names. These domains help avoid detection and facilitate communication with command and control servers for botnets and malware.
- **Characteristics:** Typically, DGA domains have random or nonsensical names, high entropy, and unusual patterns. They are designed to evade easy detection by traditional security systems.
- **Examples:**
  - `6xzxsw3sokvg1tc752y1a6p0af.com`: A domain generated by the gameoverdga algorithm.
  - `glbtlxwwhbnpxs.ru`: A domain generated by the cryptolocker algorithm.

### 2. Non-DGA Domains
- **Definition:** Legitimate domains that are not generated by DGAs. These domains are used by real websites and services for legitimate purposes, such as businesses, organizations, or personal websites.
- **Characteristics:** Non-DGA domains typically have meaningful names related to the entity they represent, lower entropy, and predictable patterns.
- **Examples:**
  - `google.com`: The domain of the Google search engine.
  - `wikipedia.org`: The domain for Wikipedia, a popular online encyclopedia.
